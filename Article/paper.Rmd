# Summary

Survival analysis is a statistical tool for evaluating time-to-event data that is widely applied across research disciplines. Commonly reported elements of survival analysis include log-rank tests, hazard ratios (HR) and Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves. KM-curves are used to compare suvival durations between two groups and give users a particular estimate of survival probability at a given time; log-rank tests are used to conduct statistical inference on suvival durations between groups; and HRs provide a ratio of the hazard rates between groups. MATLAB (MATLAB 2018A) currently lacks functions to easily create KM-plots with accompanying risk tables.  Furthermore, MATLAB does not have a built-in log-rank test, nor is one available in any of the existing toolboxes, including the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. Our goal for MatSurv is to provide an easy-to-use tool that creates publication quality KM-plots with corresponding risk tables. The statistical procedures built into MatSurv can be used to compare two or multiple groups. In addition, MatSurv allows the user to easily modify the appearance of the created figure. The graphics were inspried by the `survminer` R-package [@survminer].

# Use

MatSurv uses the Mantel-Cox, sometimes called the Mantel-Haenszel, log-rank test. Users have two options for calculating HRs: the log-rank or Mantel-Haneszel approach. In the log-rank approach, HR = (O~a~/E~a~)/(O~b~/E~b~), where O~a~ & O~b~ are the observed events in each group and E~a~ & E~b~ are the number of expected events. In the Mantel-Haenszel approach, HR = exp((O~1~-E~1~)/V), where O~1~ is the number of observed events in a group, E~1~ is the expected number of events in the same group and V is the total variance. Results from the log-rank approach will give slightly different results when compared to the Mantel-Haneszel or Cox regression approach, which is commonly used in R.

In order to use MatSurv, simply put MatSurv.m in any directory of your choice and make sure it is added to your path. At a minimum, the user should provide `TimeVar`, a vector with numeric time to event, either observed or censored, `EventVar`, a vector or cell array defining events or censoring, and `GroupVar`, a vector or cell array defining the comparison groups (see example code below). 

```{matlab, eval=FALSE}
[p,fh,stats]=MatSurv([], [], [], 'Xstep', 4, 'Title', 'MatSurv KM-Plot');
```

The function returns three pieces `p`, the log-rank p-value, `fh`, the KM-plot figure handle, and `stats`, which are additional statistics from the log-rank test. The user can further customize the style of their KM-plot (line colors, labels, ticks, etc.) by making changes to the figure handle. 

When MatSurv is creating the groups based in the median value, the default option uses values less than the median compared to all other values, however this is a parameter that can be changed by the user.

The MatSurv software has no dependencies on toolboxes and runs completely on base MATLAB functions.

# Comparison

The MatSurv output is comparable to that from `proc lifetest` in SAS and `ggsurvplot` in R. Code for reproducing similar output in R and SAS are shown below as well as the output from all 3 statistical programs (R, SAS and MatSurv).

### R 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fit <- survfit(survobj ~ RISK_CYTO, data=dat)

ggsurvplot(fit, risk.table=TRUE, pval=TRUE, risk.table.y.text.col=TRUE, risk.table.y.text=FALSE, break.time.by=24)
```

### SAS

```{sas, eval=FALSE}
proc lifetest data=lamlv2(where=(RISK_CYTO ^= 'N.D.')) intervals=(0 to 120 by 24) timelist = (0 to 120 by 24)  plots=survival(atrisk=0 to 120 by 24 test);
time OS_MONTHS*Surv(0);
strata RISK_CYTO/test=logrank;
run;
```

### MatSurv

```{matsurv, eval=FALSE}
load laml_RC_data.mat

[p,fh,stats]=MatSurv(laml_RC_TimeVar, laml_RC_EventVar,  laml_RC_GroupVar,... 'GroupsToUse', {'Good', 'Intermediate', 'Poor'}, 'Xstep', 24);
```

The results from MatSurv have been compared against both SAS and R and found to return similar estimates. The Chi-Sq values and p-calues for a long-rank test in MatSurv, SAS, and R are provided below (Table 1).
